# Some announcements

- Jan is launching ATK v2.0.0-beta.1 this week with the new architecture plus asset management and compliance foundations.
- Positioned as sales ready: we will all start building technical collateral, sales decks, demos, and marketing narratives immediately.
- Scripted client demos with engineering support to guide the experience and capture feedback.
- Stabilize the beta toward a 2.0.0 production release while iterating to close remaining v1 feature gaps cfr the commitments from yesterday.
- Kudos to the team for turning the Asset Tokenization Kit vision into something tangible.

<!--
Speaker notes:
We are releasing ATK v2.0.0-beta.1 this week. The new architecture is live with core modules for asset lifecycle management and compliance. It does not yet mirror every v1 feature, but the foundations are solid.
Because the beta is sales ready, we should equip sales and marketing now--demos, whitepapers, case studies, and slide decks that showcase the platform's value.
Client demos will run in controlled settings with engineering present to answer technical questions and handle hiccups. These previews let us gather real feedback, generate momentum, and seed pilot engagements.
Engineering has two parallel priorities: stabilize the beta into a 2.0.0 GA release with rigorous testing and hardening, and continue adding features to reach and exceed v1 parity. The new architecture enables capabilities we could not deliver before, so iteration continues even post-GA.

# What will we do in this session

- I'm doing a general version of my personal positioning of the new and improved ATK. Slides on https://book-of-dalp.settlemint.com/slides
- There is an AI enabled, in depth write up on https://book-of-dalp.settlemint.com for internal consumption
- When i'm done, 4 teams (mixed product/growth) will get a usecase/persona and will do the pitch themselves, tailored to the client
- From tomorrow, we will all work together to finetune this entire story so it is perfect for our prospects

# System Breakdown

- Issuers juggle five or more vendors across issuance, KYC, custody, trading, settlement, and reporting, and every integration degrades reliability.
- Compliance logic runs off-ledger in spreadsheets and middleware, so tokens can move unchecked while false positives slow legitimate investors.
- Custody defaults to single-key wallets with no multi-signature approval or policy controls, failing bank-grade due diligence.
- Cash and tokens settle on separate rails, masking T+2 reconciliations behind "instant" interfaces with no true delivery-versus-payment.
- Corporate actions stay manual, forcing teams to reconcile dividends, coupons, and voting via email threads and cron jobs.
- Enterprises still lack options for permissioned networks, on-prem installs, SSO integration, and data residency, so risk committees stall projects.

Speaker notes:
The market for tokenized real-world assets is booming--over $50B on-chain in 2024 and projected north of $500B in 2025--yet that is still tiny against the $230 trillion global asset pool. Institutions want in, regulators like the EU with MiCA are clarifying the rules, so why isn't tokenization scaling faster? Today's tech stack is a patchwork of point solutions and legacy processes that add risk, latency, reconciliation churn, and low trust. That is exactly what institutions reject.
Let's break down the pain points. Fragmentation forces issuers to string together disparate tools--issuance portals, investor onboarding, custody, exchanges, settlement workarounds, and reporting spreadsheets. Every handoff is a failure point. Governance turns into finger pointing, procurement drags, and developers spend time on plumbing instead of product experiences.
Compliance stays bolted on. Most platforms maintain off-chain whitelists or manual checks after a transfer fires, so the token never knows the rules. Edge cases sneak through while legitimate transactions get flagged. Regulators see that gap and push back because there is no ex-ante enforcement.
Custody does not pass the bank test. A single hot wallet key with no multi-signature approvals or hardware protection is unacceptable. There is no segregation of duties, no hardened recovery, and one mistake can vaporize assets.
Settlement is not atomic. Cash still clears on T+2 rails while the token leg updates instantly, leaving reconciliation and counterparty risk exposed. Interfaces may promise instant settlement, but behind the scenes teams are reconciling days later.
Post-issuance servicing is a slog. Dividends, redemptions, votes, and regulatory reports still run through spreadsheets and email. The ledger may track ownership, yet the operations are not automated or auditable in real time.
Enterprise requirements are ignored. Banks want on-prem or dedicated deployments, SSO, MFA, audit logs, and data residency. Many crypto-native stacks assume public chains and multi-tenant SaaS are fine. That assumption collapses in front of a bank's procurement or risk committee.

# Digital Asset Lifecycle Platform

- Unified lifecycle core: issuance, onboarding, compliance, custody, secondary trading, settlement, and reporting operate on one shared source of truth.
- Compliance by design: KYC, KYB, accreditation, and jurisdictional policies are embedded in code and enforced before a transfer executes.
- Bank-grade custody and settlement: HSM-secured key management, multi-signature governance, recovery playbooks, and atomic delivery-versus-payment keep tokens and cash synchronized.
- Enterprise control: deploy on-prem, in a client cloud, or as dedicated SaaS with SSO, MFA, SAML/OIDC, SIEM hooks, and data residency guarantees.
- Developer and operator tooling: modern APIs, SDKs, webhooks, sandbox environments, and dashboards, keep teams building rather than rewiring plumbing.

<!--
Speaker notes:
Solving the entrenched problems demands a single integrated Digital Asset Lifecycle Platform instead of a patchwork. A DALP replaces the maze of vendors with one programmable control plane that keeps the ownership registry, business rules, and records aligned. That is exactly what institutional clients ask for: a single plane of control where identities and transfers are wired together and cash settles with the asset.
A DALP is not just an issuance wizard, a custody add-on, or an exchange with an API. It is lifecycle infrastructure that removes every manual handoff. To earn the name, the platform must meet non-negotiable criteria--the laws of a DALP.
Unified lifecycle core means every phase from token creation to ongoing servicing and reporting lives on one unified platform and data model. Every state change--transfer, corporate action, ownership update--remains authoritative and auditable in a single place.
Compliance by design wires identity and regulatory logic into the asset so transactions are compliant before they touch the chain. If a move violates rules, it never executes. That gives regulators and risk teams ex-ante control and evidence.
Custody plus settlement clarity elevates the stack to traditional finance standards with HSM-backed keys, multi-signature approvals, recovery procedures, and connectors into regulated custodians. Settlement must be atomic delivery-versus-payment, with connectivity to payment rails like SWIFT, SEPA, or RTGS and alignment with ISO 20022 messaging.
Enterprise control allows deployment wherever the client needs, supports white-label branding, respects SSO and MFA policies, and provides audit trails and data residency. The platform must fit enterprise IT instead of forcing enterprise teams to bend.
Developer and operator instrumentation gives builders APIs, SDKs, sandboxes, and event streams to extend the platform easily while providing dashboards and alerts so daily operations never feel like a black box.
Proof through metrics matters because clients want measurable outcomes: near-total same-day settlement, no compliance slip-ups, high first-attempt success, rapid onboarding, and enterprise-grade uptime. Those numbers prove the approach moves the needle on risk and efficiency.

# SettleMint Asset Tokenization Kit

- Full-stack DALP implementation that collapses issuance, compliance, custody, settlement, and servicing into one integrated system.
- Compliance embedded in code via on-chain identity registries and a policy engine so every transaction enforces eligibility before it finalizes.
- Integrated custody and atomic settlement with HSM-backed keys, multi-signature governance, recovery workflows, and cash legs that move in lockstep with tokens.
- Enterprise-ready deployment across on-prem, client cloud, or dedicated SaaS, plugging into corporate IAM stacks and producing audit logs on demand.
- Developer-friendly foundation with open APIs, SDKs, modular web UI, webhooks, and sandbox environments for rapid customization and iteration.

<!--
Speaker notes:
SettleMint's Asset Tokenization Kit is our production-ready DALP in a box. It translates the DALP laws into a product so an issuer no longer needs five vendors; one platform covers the entire lifecycle.
Unified core: The kit provides a live ownership registry and workflow engine. Every action--transfers, corporate actions, redemptions--updates a single source of truth in real time, eliminating scattered spreadsheets and systems.
Embedded compliance: The kit leverages the ERC-3643 standard to put compliance in the asset's DNA. An on-chain identity registry tracks approved investors and credentials. A rule engine checks whether a participant is KYC-verified and authorized for a given jurisdiction before a transaction lands on-chain. Non-compliant moves are blocked upfront, and every decision logs for audit.
Custody and settlement: We ship an institutional-grade custody module with HSM-based key management, multi-signature approvals, recovery workflows, and optional integrations with third-party custodians such as Fireblocks or Copper. Settlement is built for atomic exchange using tokenized cash, stablecoins, or escrow that keeps both legs synchronized. Connectors translate to ISO 20022 and link to SWIFT or SEPA so traditional payments stay in sync with blockchain movements.
Enterprise readiness: Clients can deploy on-prem, in their private cloud, or in an isolated SaaS instance. The kit supports SSO, MFA, role-based access, audit logging, SIEM export, and localization, so IT and risk teams feel at home.
Developer and operator tools: We provide complete APIs, SDKs, a customizable web app, and a sandbox so developers can extend the platform without waiting on our roadmap. Operators get dashboards, event monitoring, and alerting to manage governance and compliance in real time. Early users report developing about four times faster on smart contracts and eight times faster on front-end flows compared with building from scratch.
