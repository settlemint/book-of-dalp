# Book of DALP Pitch
### Borrowing chapter titles to keep the story consistent

System Breakdown, DALP Overview, Proof Through Metrics, and the rest--this deck mirrors the book so teams can move between formats without translation friction.

# System Breakdown
### The system is broken

Institutional pilots still depend on brittle integrations, off-ledger compliance, single-key wallets, and manual settlement. That mashup slows every launch and makes regulators uneasy.

<!--
Speaker notes:
Real-world assets have crossed $50B on-chain and are heading toward $500B+, yet that's tiny against the $230T base. Intent is high, regulatory clarity is improving, but the stack keeps projects stuck. The problem is fragmentation, bolt-on compliance, weak custody, non-atomic settlement, and manual servicing. Institutions need proof the lifecycle is controlled before they scale.
-->

---

# Fragmentation: Five Vendors for One Lifecycle

- Issuers juggle issuance portals, KYC/KYB, custody, trading venues, settlement workarounds, and reporting spreadsheets.
- Every handoff adds latency, reconciliation debt, and vendor finger pointing.
- Procurement drags, governance dilutes, and developers spend cycles wiring plumbing instead of features.

<!--
Speaker notes:
A typical tokenization project strings together disparate tools. Each integration is brittle. Institutions face multi-vendor procurement and governance headaches, while investors see inconsistent onboarding. Developers burn time recreating pipelines rather than building product.
-->

---

# Compliance as a Bolt-On (Not in the Asset Path)

- Compliance lives in middleware or spreadsheets the token never sees.
- Edge transfers slip through while legitimate ones get blocked by false positives.
- Regulators hesitate because firms cannot prove ex-ante enforcement.

<!--
Speaker notes:
Compliance gets checked after transfers are queued. Whitelists sit off-chain, jurisdiction rules run manually, so the token doesn't enforce anything. Regulators and risk teams want proof that rules execute before state changes.
-->

---

# Custody Isn't Bank-Grade

- Many platforms still operate single-key hot wallets with no multi-sig or policy engine.
- No HSM-backed governance, segregation of duties, or recovery workflows.
- Risk committees will never approve institutional scale under those conditions.

<!--
Speaker notes:
Crypto-native custody approaches fail bank diligence. Without HSMs, multi-sig approvals, and recovery plans, one compromise can vaporize assets. Serious investors walk away when custody feels improvised.
-->

---

# Cash and Tokens Don't Settle Together

- Token legs may update instantly, but cash often trails on T+2 rails.
- Behind "instant" UIs sit escrow accounts, emails, and reconciliation spreadsheets.
- Counterparty risk lingers until both legs match, keeping capital idle.

<!--
Speaker notes:
Without atomic delivery-versus-payment, settlement becomes a prayer. Operations scramble to reconcile, delaying access to funds and undermining trust.
-->

---

# Corporate Actions Stay Manual

- Dividends, coupons, votes, and tax handling still run through emails and cron jobs.
- Ledgers capture ownership, yet servicing relies on parallel records.
- Errors, missed record dates, and audit gaps follow.

<!--
Speaker notes:
Post-issuance servicing is a labor-heavy scramble. Automation is absent, so every lifecycle event spawns coordination across operations, legal, and engineering with spreadsheets as the glue.
-->

---

# Enterprise Requirements Are Ignored

- Public-only stacks lack permissioned deployment, data residency, or on-prem options.
- No native SSO, MFA, audit logging, or SIEM feeds--deal breakers for banks.
- Risk committees halt projects when environments cannot be controlled.

<!--
Speaker notes:
Most tokenization platforms evolved from crypto startups. They assume shared SaaS on public chains is acceptable. Enterprises need deployment choice, IAM integration, and audit transparency. Without that, procurement blocks progress.
-->

---

# DALP Overview
### The fix the book describes

A Digital Asset Lifecycle Platform collapses issuance, compliance, custody, settlement, and servicing into one programmable control plane where the ownership registry, business rules, and records stay in sync.

<!--
Speaker notes:
A DALP is lifecycle infrastructure, not another point tool. It gives institutions a single control surface where identities, transfers, and cash legs are wired together. That is the promise clients keep repeating.
-->

---

# DALP Laws (Non-Negotiables)

1. Unified lifecycle core keeps issuance, servicing, and reporting on one registry.
2. Compliance-by-design enforces KYC/KYB and jurisdiction rules before state changes.
3. Custody plus settlement clarity pairs HSM key control with atomic DvP.
4. Enterprise control covers deployment choice, IAM, logs, and residency guarantees.
5. Developer and operator instrumentation delivers APIs, SDKs, sandboxes, and alerts.
6. Proof through metrics targets ~99% T+0 settlement, zero compliance breaches, <24h KYC, and 99.9% uptime.

<!--
Speaker notes:
Missing any law means you're back to an integration project. These principles define what makes DALP credible to risk teams and regulators.
-->

---

# Asset Tokenization Kit
### Our DALP implementation

SettleMint's Asset Tokenization Kit (ATK) operationalizes every DALP law: unified registry, compliance in code, bank-grade custody, atomic settlement, enterprise deployment control, and tooling for builders and operators.

<!--
Speaker notes:
ATK is a production-ready DALP. Issuers no longer need five vendors. Compliance, custody, settlement, and servicing ship together with governance baked in.
-->

---

# Asset Tokenization Kit Modules

- Issuance designer with jurisdiction templates and policy-aware lifecycle primitives.
- Compliance engine using ERC-3643 identity registries and pre-transfer rule checks.
- Custody workbench with HSMs, multi-sig governance, recovery flows, and custodian connectors.
- Settlement plane for atomic DvP across tokenized cash, stablecoins, and bank rails (ISO 20022 adapters included).
- Operations room with dashboards, alerts, and exception handling.
- IAM and developer layer supporting SSO/MFA/SAML/OIDC, SDKs, APIs, webhooks, and sandbox environments.

<!--
Speaker notes:
Each module is in production pilots. Developers build faster--roughly four times faster on smart contracts and eight times faster on front-end flows--because primitives already exist. Operators monitor eligibility, settlement, and corporate actions in real time.
-->

---

# Proof Through Metrics

- ~99% of transactions target T+0 settlement with first-attempt success around 99%.
- Zero compliance breaches thanks to policy enforcement before each transfer.
- KYC processing inside 24 hours with high auto-approval rates.
- Platform uptime above 99.9% for end-user channels, keeping trust high.

<!--
Speaker notes:
We measure outcomes relentlessly. These metrics prove DALP is not only conceptually sound but materially better on risk, speed, and control.
-->

---

# Release Path: ATK v2.0.0-beta.1

- Shipping this week with the new DALP architecture plus asset management and compliance foundations.
- Beta is sales ready--time to craft collateral, demos, and narratives.
- Run demos in controlled settings with engineering in the loop.
- Stabilize toward the 2.0.0 GA release while closing remaining v1 gaps and adding net-new capability.

<!--
Speaker notes:
The beta launch marks an inflection point. We'll support sales and marketing immediately, gather field feedback via guided demos, and drive engineering toward GA with iterative feature adds.
-->

# Thank You

Huge credit to Product Strategy and Engineering for making the Asset Tokenization Kit real. Questions on platform details, roadmap, or go-to-market? Let's dig in.

<!--
Speaker notes:
Acknowledge the cross-functional effort and open the floor. Invite questions about the platform, roadmap, or how this momentum drives business outcomes.
