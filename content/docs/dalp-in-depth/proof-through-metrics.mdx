title: "Metrics & Proof"
description: "Metrics are the validator for every promise in the DALP. Institutions, regulators, and executives expect continuous proof that lifecycle automation, compliance, custody, and settlement work exactly as advertised. The DALP treats telemetry, KPIs, and evidence packs as product features, not quarterly reports, so the proof never goes stale."

## Why proof matters

Tokenization programs fail when success is anecdotal. Without hard numbers on settlement windows, compliance outcomes, and uptime, risk committees and regulators assume the worst. Proof through metrics converts the DALP from a vision deck into an audited system, which is exactly the comfort risk committees demand.

## Core KPI dashboard

| Metric | Target | Current (rolling 90 days) | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Settlement finality | T+0 on >=99% of lifecycle transactions | 99.2% | Settlement engine telemetry |
| First-attempt success | >=99% | 99.1% | REST workflow logs (OpenAPI catalog) |
| Compliance incidents | 0 breaches | 0 | Rule-engine evidence bundles |
| KYC turnaround | \<24 hours | 16 hours p95 | Identity registry metrics |
| Custody safekeeping | 100% | 99.99% | HSM audit feed |
| UX availability | >=99.9% | 99.95% | Synthetic monitoring |
| Test coverage | >90% | 94% | CI quality reports |

KPIs are emitted as time-series data, versioned with the release that produced them, and exposed to both internal and customer dashboards with identical definitions.

## Evidence automation

Dashboards alone are not enough. The DALP packages compliance decisions, custody approvals, settlement proofs, servicing receipts, and test reports into immutable evidence bundles:

- **Release bundles** contain build hashes, automated test suites, vulnerability scans, and change approvals.
- **Lifecycle bundles** capture transfer attempts, module decisions, signature trails, payment confirmations, and reconciliation outcomes.
- **Regulatory bundles** export MiCA/SEC/FINRA/MAS-specific data in regulator-friendly formats, signed and timestamped for non-repudiation.

Scheduled exports (daily/weekly/monthly) feed finance, risk, and regulatory teams. API endpoints let customers pull the same evidence into their data warehouses or GRC platforms without bespoke integrations.

## Optimization loops

Metrics are wired into product operations:

1. **Alerting thresholds** raise incidents when settlement latency creeps beyond SLA, false-positive compliance blocks increase, or API p95 exceeds targets.
2. **Post-incident reviews** link telemetry to remediation work tracked in the monorepo, ensuring fixes are version-controlled and repeatable.
3. **Roadmaps** prioritize improvements that move KPIs (e.g., increasing automation percentage in corporate actions, reducing identity onboarding time) over vanity features.
4. **Testing correlation** keeps coverage, reliability, and performance metrics in lockstep with release cadence; no release cuts if quality gates fail.

## Guardrails for trustworthy reporting

1. KPIs must be sourced directly from the DALP runtime, with no manual spreadsheets or sampled data in the loop.
2. Every metric has an owner, threshold, and response playbook tied to alerting policies.
3. Evidence bundles are cryptographically signed and stored with retention policies that satisfy SOC 2, MiCA, and jurisdictional requirements.
4. Customers receive the same views as internal teams, with tenancy isolation but identical definitions, eliminating reporting mismatches.

Proof through metrics closes the trust loop and keeps the narrative grounded in facts. When the DALP can demonstrate performance, compliance, and reliability continuously, institutions stop treating tokenization as an experiment and start treating it as core infrastructure.
