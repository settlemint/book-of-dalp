title: "Ops & Instrumentation"
description: "Developer and operator instrumentation is how the DALP keeps lifecycle operations, especially corporate actions and reporting, deterministic. When servicing, custody, and settlement share the same telemetry and automation, institutions see one coherent platform instead of a black box."

## Why tooling and servicing depth matter

Tokenization programs collapse when servicing lives in spreadsheets or when engineers fly blind, and that pattern has played out often enough to sting. Without typed APIs, reproducible environments, and actionable telemetry, integration teams stall, operations improvise, and regulators assume the worst. Instrumentation ties lifecycle accuracy to hard evidence so the DALP can scale safely, which is exactly what risk committees expect to hear.

## Asset servicing inside the DALP

Corporate actions, distributions, and reporting run as first-class workflows. Record dates, entitlement logic, approvals, and notifications are encoded alongside token logic and identity data. Workflow engines trigger servicing events, collect authorization, and generate receipts. Access control, audit logging, and compliance checks mirror transfer and settlement flows, ensuring eligibility rules fire before any action executes. Reporting engines compile position, transaction, and performance views from shared PostgreSQL and Subgraph stores, producing regulator-ready exports without manual reformatting.

## Operator control room: observability and automation

Operations teams monitor settlement latency, approval queue depth, servicing SLAs, wallet balances, and API health from a single console. Structured logs and traces feed SIEM/SOC pipelines, while alerting policies invoke runbooks for custody incidents, compliance breaches, or payment failures. Automated reconciliation compares on-chain state, custody records, and investor statements so discrepancies trigger alerts immediately. Exceptions (missed payments, failed notices, disputed votes) re-enter the workflow with audit trails intact.

## Developer surface: APIs, SDKs, and sandboxes

The Asset Tokenization Kit ships with OpenAPI-documented REST APIs, GraphQL subgraphs, and versioned SDKs so builders compose lifecycle flows rather than hack around them. Schema validation via Zod, typed responses, and contract ABIs live in shared packages to keep frontends, backends, and integrations aligned. Sandbox environments mirror production topologies, seeded with sample assets and rule libraries, letting teams test servicing scenarios, compliance edge cases, and payment adapters before promotions.

## Stakeholder leverage

- **Developers** automate issuance, servicing, reporting, and settlement through well-documented APIs, webhooks, and CLI tooling.
- **Operations teams** correlate business metrics with infrastructure signals, rehearse failovers, and resolve exceptions through guided workflows instead of ad hoc spreadsheets.
- **Compliance and risk teams** consume real-time dashboards and export evidence packs that trace every decision path.
- **Partners and clients** receive consistent artifacts such as API docs, SDKs, and test harnesses that shorten onboarding cycles.

## Instrumentation invariants

1. Every capability ships with an API, schema, and example workflows; undocumented functionality is treated as a defect.
2. Telemetry spans business and technical signals and feeds both customer and internal observability stacks by default.
3. Automation favors declarative runbooks and version-controlled configurations so operations scale without bespoke scripts.
4. Sandboxes stay in lockstep with production releases, guaranteeing that what teams test is what goes live.

Instrumentation turns lifecycle servicing from a manual chore into an auditable, programmable system, and the difference shows up in every regulator meeting. With operations, developers, and compliance sharing the same toolchain, the DALP delivers the reliability regulators demand and the velocity builders expect.
