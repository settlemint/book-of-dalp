## Closing the settlement gap

Traditional systems create windows of counterparty risk while one leg clears and the other waits. ATK removes that risk by design: both sides complete their obligation, or the trade unwinds automatically.

## Atomic DvP in practice

The Cross-Value Proposition (XvP) addon ships escrow contracts, settlement validators, and atomic engines.

When both legs live on-chain, finality is T+0. When cash sits on bank rails, ATK sends ISO 20022-aligned instructions through the payment-rails architecture and waits for confirmation before releasing the token leg. Result: no partial deliveries, no manual reconciliation queues, and an audit trail for every instruction.

## Payment networks and ISO 20022

ATK ships playbooks and addons for SWIFT, ACH, SEPA, RTGS, and other hubs. Token events map to ISO 20022 and legacy MT/MX messages so correspondent banking, RTGS, and batch processing stay coordinated. Teams choose the rails they need; ATK keeps confirmation handling, retries, and compliance hooks consistent once connectors go live.

## Interoperability roadmap

The current release focuses on same-network atomicity. Cross-network movement remains a roadmap track with conceptual playbooks. The principle remains: no asset moves without the right policy controls, and both legs settle together or not at all.

## Developer surface

Settlement contracts, Hasura, subgraphs, and Portal APIs expose events and helper routes. ORPC procedures let teams compose, monitor, and reconcile settlements without bespoke plumbing. ISO 20022 and MT/MX builders described in the payment-rails docs use the same surfaces, so bank integrations share code with on-chain settlement.

## KPIs to watch

Programs track atomic settlement success rates, average time to finality for on-chain DvP, fiat-linked DvP, and token swaps, plus reconciliation exceptions raised during policy checks. As payment connectors move into production, teams add bank confirmation latency, ISO 20022 acknowledgement rates, and cross-network availability to dashboards.

## Failure handling

If a bank confirmation stalls, the escrow contract times out, reverts, and notifies each party with context. Bridges refuse to mint on chains that miss policy, even if that denies the transfer. When ledger and bank views diverge, the ISO 20022 message flow becomes the system of record for booking and reconciliation, removing ambiguity.

## Why this approach is different

ATK delivers genuine delivery versus payment with real bank integrations and atomic transactions. Assets either settle together or they do not settle. There are no IOUs and no “instant” settlements backed by T+2 rails.
