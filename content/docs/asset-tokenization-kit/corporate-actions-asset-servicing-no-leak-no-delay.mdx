## Corporate actions and servicing

The Asset Tokenization Kit (ATK) turns corporate actions into deterministic workflows. Declarations start in guided wizards, record-date snapshots lock eligible balances, and payouts execute through the same contracts that issued the asset. Operations teams see the cadence in a single console instead of juggling email threads.

Redemptions, buybacks, and dividend runs share the same pattern: balances are snapshotted, eligibility checks run, and the addon executes a single transaction that debits the source wallet and credits every holder. Cap-table views update in the same pass, so reconciliation never trails cash movement.

Voting and governance reuse the record-date snapshots, producing auditable logs with block references, signer attestations, and distribution receipts. If a disclosure window or filing threshold triggers, the runtime pauses the event until the required approval lands, which keeps legal and operations in sync.

## Contract primitives built in

- `SMARTYieldUpgradeable` tracks coupon schedules and historical yields, so payout math never depends on off-chain spreadsheets.
- `SMARTRedeemableUpgradeable` and `SMARTCustodianUpgradeable` coordinate redemption windows, denomination coverage, and post-maturity flows.
- `SMARTHistoricalBalancesUpgradeable` stores immutable balance checkpoints for pro-rata events and regulatory evidence.

The bond implementation wires these modules together, enforcing maturity rules, denomination assets, and transfer locks. Equity and fund templates follow the same pattern with share-class voting, distribution locks, and NAV hooks.

## Addons for structured actions

- Yield addon distributes coupons or dividends to verified holders and skips blocked accounts automatically.
- Vault addon segregates collateral and handles waterfall distributions for securitized products.
- Sale and airdrop addons cover secondary allocations, incentives, and treasury movements with role-gated execution.

## Zero-leak workflow

1. Operators schedule a payout or redemption in the Asset Manager, supplying record date, pay date, funding accounts, and overrides.
2. Historical balance modules confirm eligible balances and preview reports; compliance modules run checks on the target holders.
3. The addon executes a batched transaction that debits the custodian wallet and applies the distribution on-chain.
4. Subgraph and Hasura layers emit updated ledgers so finance, compliance, and auditors pull the same evidence.

## Operational guardrails

- Access roles split governance, supply, custody, and emergency permissions so dual control stays intact.
- Meta-transaction support enables gas-sponsored servicing from hardened consoles.
- Every addon emits typed events; the subgraph stores inputs, hashes, and per-investor outcomes for audit review.
- REST (with detailed OpenAPI docs) and GraphQL routes mirror the UI, letting custodians and transfer agents automate the same flows from their own systems.

With ATK, servicing lives in the same runtime as issuance: coupons land on time, redemptions enforce coverage, and every action leaves a verifiable footprint.
