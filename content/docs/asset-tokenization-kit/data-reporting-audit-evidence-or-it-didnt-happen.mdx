## Evidence in one place

Financial teams judge platforms by how fast they can answer what happened and why. ATK pairs the shared ledger with operational stores, reporting APIs, and export tooling, so nobody hunts for spreadsheets when regulators call. All heavy lifting—normalization, scheduling, validation—runs inside the platform.

Every interaction lands in two sources: the on-chain event stream and the Postgres-backed operational store. Graph and Hasura views expose instantaneous cap tables, while ORPC routes provide consented slices of PII or workflow metadata. Compliance officers can prove holder positions, permissions, and overrides without shadow systems.

Localized, white-labeled portals render the same artifacts for investors and issuers: payout receipts, voting confirmations, redemption statements, reconciliation packs, claim histories. ISO 20022 mapping translates token movements to booking messages, eliminating the spreadsheet merge marathons that still dominate many back offices.

## Reporting that survives review

Scheduled jobs run against typed ORPC routes, so regulatory filings, compliance attestations, and jurisdictional reports pull live data. The reporting module parameterizes audience, format, and sign-off flows; once configured, ATK renders, validates, archives, and hands the package to the right team automatically. A read-only regulatory dashboard surfaces configuration history, policy revisions, escalations, and submission status without granting write access.

## Observability for operators

Prometheus, Loki, and OpenTelemetry ship with the Helm charts, feeding Grafana dashboards for latency, error budgets, and service-level trends. The dApp overlays usage analytics (TanStack Query stats, ORPC metadata) so operators spot failing flows quickly. Logs and traces travel through the same pipelines your security team already monitors, making SIEM forwarding a configuration exercise.

## Data handling practices

Event sourcing makes approvals and overrides immutable while sensitive data stays off-chain. ATK stores hashes on the ledger and keeps personal information in encrypted Postgres tables, satisfying right-to-be-forgotten requests without losing evidence. Export jobs are deterministic—the same parameters output the same dataset—so auditors can rerun reports months later. Better Auth governs who can access exports and dashboards.

## Weekly signals

- Report run success: scheduled filings, investor statements, and reconciliation jobs finish on time.
- Exception volume: blocked transfers, manual overrides, and AML escalations stay within thresholds.
- Telemetry health: availability stays `>=99.9%`, API error rate stays `<0.1%`, traces arrive without gaps.
- Export fidelity: rerun audits reproduce identical artifacts; any drift flags schema regressions.
- Privacy posture: monitor PII access logs and retention timers to confirm off-chain stores honor policy.

Stay on top of those metrics and “evidence on demand” becomes routine instead of crisis management.
