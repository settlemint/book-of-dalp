## Why regulation lives in the platform

Treating regulation as paperwork creates mismatches between what technology can do and what the law allows. ATK embeds rule libraries, filings, alerts, token classification guidance, e-signature/eIDAS hooks, and regulatory dashboards directly in the runtime so compliant behavior is the default outcome.

It is simpler to ship policy once than to chase it ticket by ticket, which is why we treat statutes like source code.

## Where the world is (September 9, 2025)

Supervisors across major markets apply the same principle: same activity, same risk, same rules. Licensing, disclosures, AML/CTF, custody segregation, and audit-grade evidence are expected. Travel Rule obligations require that originator and beneficiary data move with value between regulated entities, so ATK encodes those checks in the settlement flows themselves.

- **European Union**: MiCA governs crypto-assets outside securities, with stablecoin obligations live since June 30, 2024 and CASP rules ramping from December 30, 2024. Tokenized securities stay under MiFID/MiFIR, while the DLT Pilot Regime grants permissions for issuance, trading, and settlement on DLT. Templates separate crypto-asset and security-token features accordingly.
- **United Kingdom**: The Digital Securities Sandbox now supports issuance, trading, and settlement under modified rules. ATK’s primary and secondary connectivity can point at sandbox venues without bespoke builds.
- **United States**: There is no omnibus “crypto law,” but the path is clear. Tokenized securities remain securities, secondary trading touches ATS, broker-dealer, and transfer-agent obligations, and Article 12 of the UCC modernizes property rights in controllable electronic records. ATK enforces registry truth and transfer restrictions inside the token path and integrates with licensed intermediaries where required.
- **Switzerland and Liechtenstein**: Mature digital-securities regimes with production venues; ATK aligns templates to their licensing requirements.
- **APAC**: Singapore finalized a stablecoin framework with reserve and redemption discipline, Hong Kong released detailed tokenized-securities and stablecoin guidance, and Korea’s STO and virtual-asset acts define perimeters for securities and non-securities. ATK mirrors those obligations in configuration.
- **Gulf**: ADGM, DIFC/DFSA, and VARA run full rulebooks for custody, issuance, exchanges, and stablecoins. ATK’s templates capture those activity-based licenses.

The environment will evolve, but today’s guidance is stable enough to build systems that obey the law by construction.

## Scope covered today

ATK’s regulatory framework focuses on markets with clear guidance for tokenization. Templates capture licensing, disclosure, reporting, and travel-rule duties for each supported jurisdiction. Every change ships as versioned code, reviewed and deployed through the same pipelines that manage contracts and APIs.

## How ATK turns law into code

- Setup wizards stitch jurisdiction, asset class, and exemption paths into templated configurations.
- Compliance modules run pre-transfer enforcement (country allowlists, investor accreditation, holding periods, transfer approvals) before state changes.
- Filing automation generates regulatory, compliance, and tax reports on the cadence institutions configure.
- Real-time alerts watch thresholds (ownership caps, disclosure triggers, travel-rule checks) and pause workflows until obligations clear.
- Token classification guidance and legal checkpoints keep product teams aligned with counsel as features evolve.
- Regulatory dashboards provide read-only access to rule updates, configuration history, filings, and escalations for supervisors and internal audit.

## Operating inside the law by design

ATK keeps legal, compliance, and engineering on the same page: regulations live in configuration, enforcement runs in smart contracts, and filings come from live data. The result is compliant behavior by default and a far easier conversation with regulators.
