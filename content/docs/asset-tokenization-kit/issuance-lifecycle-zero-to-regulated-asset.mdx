## What the issuance layer covers

ATK handles multi-asset creation across equity, debt, fund, and deposit products. Jurisdiction-specific templates (Reg D, Reg S, MiCA, MAS, others) remove guesswork, so legal and product teams configure real parameters during the first workshop instead of filling a parking lot of follow-up tasks.

The no-code Asset Designer exposes supply limits, divisibility, transfer rules, freeze periods, and corporate rights without touching Solidity. Business users keep pace with demand while engineering focuses on differentiated work.

Multi-chain deployment support launches assets on Ethereum, Polygon, Besu, Quorum, or another EVM network from one playbook. Sandbox assets promote to production networks as policy evolves, keeping rollout aligned with regulatory staging.

A real-time cap table in the Asset Manager aggregates ledger events into a current registry. Issuers see holdings, eligibility, and lifecycle actions immediately, so reconciliation never becomes the long pole.

Lifecycle primitives let issuers manage supply after launch: minting, burning, redemptions, buybacks, and follow-on issuance all enforce contract-level conditions automatically.

The distribution engine handles pro-rata lists, auctions, and bulk allocations. It hashes legal documents to token metadata, creating an immutable link between the asset and its documentation.

Gravity for all of this sits in APIs. Everything you can do in the UI is also exposed through OpenAPI-described REST endpoints and GraphQL, so banks embed issuance flows inside existing portals under their own branding.

## Compliance in the primary market

Issuance gates distribution with KYC/KYB, accreditation, and on-chain whitelisting. Verified wallets only, jurisdictional caps and lockups enforced pre-distribution, and geo rules checked before transfers. Custodial, retail, and institutional flows run the same engine, so allocations inherit the right eligibility profile automatically.

**Result:** zero non-compliant allocations and a clean audit trail out of the box.

A subgraph-backed indexer subscribes to transfer, mint, and burn events, reconciles positions instantly, and exposes query endpoints in the Asset Manager and via GraphQL. Document hashes, prospectus references, and base price claims live alongside the assetâ€™s on-chain identity, keeping legal artifacts auditable from launch through redemption.

Distribution runs through addons (airdrop, sale, yield) that log every step for audits.

## Operational guardrails

Pre-transfer checks either succeed or revert; there is no limbo state. Jurisdictional profiles cover the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, Singapore, Japan, and more. Compliance teams adjust parameters through configuration instead of code edits, and the Asset Manager exposes receipts, holder-by-jurisdiction breakdowns, blocked-transfer ledgers, and lifecycle actions on demand.

Law-in-the-loop issuance means legal templates drive the parameters contracts enforce. Stablecoin and deposit products attach base price claims; supply-limit modules convert minted amounts against reference currency to uphold lifetime or rolling caps. Prospectus thresholds raise alerts before limits are breached and pause execution until filings complete.

## Proof the layer works

Teams routinely move from term sheet to pilot in days, compressing timelines by more than 4x thanks to templated compliance, pre-built integrations, and automated pipelines. Automation keeps the cap table, eligibility checks, and lifecycle actions synchronized; human intervention is reserved for authorized exceptions.

Scale metrics track healthy issuance volume across multiple asset types per region and the throughput of lifecycle events processed by the addon framework. Strong numbers signal the platform is operating as a single system rather than a bundle of point tools.

## Why ATK beats point solutions

Issuance wizards without cap-table truth or embedded compliance create rework and legal risk. ATK ships templated legality, cap-table truth, and programmable lifecycle in one system, plus:

- A no-code designer business teams can own without trading safety for speed.
- An addon ecosystem (airdrop, yield, XvP, vault) packaging complex distribution and settlement workflows.
- API and UI surfaces that expose every action through secure endpoints and real-time dashboards, so partners embed issuance flows in existing channels without rebuilding the core.
