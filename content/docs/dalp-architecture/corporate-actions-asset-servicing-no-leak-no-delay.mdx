title: "Corporate Actions"
description: "Post-issuance servicing is where trust is won or lost. Spreadsheets, missed record dates, and cash leaks kill institutional confidence. Our Corporate Actions module orchestrates dividends, coupons, votes, redemptions, splits, mergers, tax handling, notifications, and receipts with record-date discipline, multi-rail payouts, and end-to-end audit trails so every action lands on time and matches the ledger."

## What it automates

The Corporate Actions module replaces the spreadsheet choreography that slows down dividends, coupons, and governance. Declarations start in guided wizards that align to regulatory notice periods, then flow into automated pro-rata calculations and payout orchestration. Payouts can settle on-chain or through connected ACH, SEPA, SWIFT, or RTGS rails, producing receipts for issuers and holders without manual exports.

The predictable cadence means operations teams finally stop babysitting spreadsheets overnight because the platform handles the handoffs the way auditors expect.

Redemptions and buybacks run as deterministic flows: balances are snapshotted, tokens are frozen, entitlements are calculated, and payouts are executed before redeemed supply is burned or escrowed. Cap-table and Asset Manager views update in the same pass, so reconciliation never trails the cash movement.

Voting and governance leverage record-date snapshots and eligibility checks enforced by the compliance layer. Results ship with an auditable trail: block references, signer attestations, and distribution receipts-that satisfy internal and external reviewers.

Corporate events such as splits, mergers, conversions, and rights offerings follow templated workflows with automated validation at each step. Logs, notifications, and final reports are captured automatically so operations, finance, and compliance work from the same source of truth.

Fund administration hooks handle NAV ingestion, periodic issuances/redemptions at current NAV, and yield schedules set once in the REST API portal (e.g., `token.set-yield-schedule`) with OpenAPI definitions backing every call. Once configured, income distributions ride the same servicing rails as dividends.

## Compliance never "falls off"

Every entitlement checks the same whitelists and rules as transfers. Ineligible holders don't receive distributions; conversions inherit target-asset rules; record-date locks prevent disputes. When a jurisdiction imposes disclosure windows or notice periods, the declaration wizard encodes them and the runtime enforces them; if thresholds flip a filing obligation mid-action, the system raises a legal alert and pauses the payout until the filing is acknowledged. The outcome is simple: the legal position cannot drift out of sync with servicing operations.

## The execution path

Corporate actions follow a five-step execution path that eliminates the manual coordination that creates errors in traditional systems. The process starts when the issuer declares the action by setting parameters like payment amounts, record dates, and eligibility criteria. The system validates these against legal thresholds and regulatory notice requirements before proceeding.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <strong>Declare the action.</strong> Issuers set payment amounts, record dates, and eligibility rules. Compliance validates notice periods and filing triggers before the workflow progresses.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Snapshot holders.</strong> The platform captures the record-date ledger and can apply a temporary transfer lock so later movements do not upset entitlement math.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Compute entitlements.</strong> Pro-rata calculations and tax withholding run automatically while jurisdiction, accreditation, and asset rules block ineligible holders.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Execute payouts.</strong> Stablecoin and bank rails fire in parallel, generating investor receipts and issuer reports, with reserve attestations attached when digital cash is involved.

    <strong>Archive the evidence.</strong> The system reconciles tokens, cash, and withholdings, then stores audit-ready packs so reviews start with aligned numbers instead of manual exports.

## What "good" looks like

Success gets measured through specific performance targets that demonstrate system reliability. Corporate actions complete within their service windows-dividends inside 24 hours, income runs inside four, and reporting inside an hour-so issuers can depend on predictable settlement.

Reconciliation focuses on keeping issuer outflow, investor inflow, and withheld taxes in lockstep; exception rates stay below one percent and are tracked in a governed queue instead of hidden in email threads.

Automation rates north of 80% on corporate action processing (and 95% for income) keep operations teams focused on edge cases rather than repetitive data entry. Human involvement is reserved for approvals, multi-option events, or cross-border nuances that still require judgment.

Digital voting surfaces stay available and easy to use, lifting participation well above the paper baseline and giving governance teams current data without mailing campaigns.

## Interfaces that matter

The developer surface stays minimal while handling complex workflows behind the scenes. Yield and distribution schedules are configured via the API Portal's OpenAPI-described REST endpoints (see `fixed-yield-schedule.*` and `token.set-yield-schedule` in [Appendix C - API Surface & Webhooks Index](Appendix%20C%20-%20API%20Surface%20%26%20Webhooks%20Index)). Payment instructions can be triggered through the same surface regardless of whether the payout uses stablecoins, domestic ACH, or cross-border SWIFT rails.

Back-office teams work out of the Asset Manager dashboards to monitor timelines, approve exceptions, and download ready-to-file reports. Redemptions and tenders follow guided flows that freeze eligible balances, compute payouts, and coordinate settlement atomically to prevent partial execution failures. Receipts and tax records are generated on demand; issuer-level reports provide accuracy proofs and auditor packages without manual compilation.

## Why competitors fail here

Most "tokenization" products stop at mint. Servicing is left to email and Excel. We ship **record-date locks, payout rails, tax, receipts, and audits** in one runtime. That's the difference between a demo and infrastructure.
