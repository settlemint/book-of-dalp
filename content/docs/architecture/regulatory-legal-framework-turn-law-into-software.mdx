title: "Regulatory Framework"
description: "Regulations aren't paperwork; they're logic. The DALP ships a jurisdictional rule library, setup wizards, automatic filings, real‑time regulatory alerts, token classification guidance, e‑signature/eIDAS hooks, and a regulatory audit dashboard, all wired into compliance and operations. You operate inside the law by construction."

Most tokenization platforms treat regulatory compliance as an afterthought, a layer of paperwork and manual processes built on top of technical infrastructure designed without regulatory considerations. This approach creates fundamental misalignments between what the technology can do and what regulations allow, forcing organizations into complex workarounds that introduce operational risk and compliance gaps.

The reality is that regulatory requirements aren't constraints to work around; they're business logic that should be embedded directly into system architecture. When regulatory rules are implemented as executable code rather than manual procedures, compliance becomes automatic rather than aspirational.

## Where the world is (September 9, 2025)

Across major markets the pattern is now consistent: same activity, same risk, same rules. Supervisors are technology‑neutral, but they expect licensing, disclosures, AML/CTF, custody segregation, and audit‑grade operational evidence. The connective tissue between regimes is the Travel‑Rule family: when value moves between regulated entities, verified originator/beneficiary data must move with it. We encode these duties directly in flows rather than treating them as paperwork, so conformance becomes the default outcome of routine operations.

Europe has become the most complete rule set. Crypto‑asset rules outside securities are under MiCA, with stablecoin requirements in force from June 30, 2024 and the broader CASP regime ramped from December 30, 2024. Tokenized securities remain squarely under MiFID/MiFIR and related market‑infrastructure law; the DLT Pilot Regime created specific permissions for issuance, trading, and settlement on DLT without unpicking the entire framework. This is why we separate “crypto‑asset” features from “security‑token” features in product templates and filings rather than trying to shoehorn both into one label.

The UK has moved from consultation to live infrastructure via the Digital Securities Sandbox, where issuance, trading, and settlement of digital securities operate under modified rules with joint policy and supervision. We design primary/secondary connectivity so that when an operator is admitted to the sandbox the DALP can be pointed at it without bespoke builds.

The United States has not enacted a single omnibus “crypto law,” but the direction is clear enough to build against today. Tokenized securities are securities; secondary trading touches ATS/broker‑dealer/transfer‑agent obligations; and commercial law has modernized through Article 12 of the UCC so controllable electronic records can carry property rights and settle cleanly. Our U.S. posture is therefore simple: choose an exemption or registration path for the instrument, integrate with licensed intermediaries where needed, and ensure cap‑table truth and transfer restrictions are enforced in the token path, not in off‑chain spreadsheets.

Switzerland and Liechtenstein continue to operate turnkey models for digital securities with clear licensing and, increasingly, production‑grade market venues. In APAC, Singapore has finalized a stablecoin framework with reserves and redemption discipline while keeping securities under existing capital‑markets law; Hong Kong has published detailed tokenized‑securities guidance and a stablecoin licensing regime; and Korea’s STO guidance plus its virtual‑asset user‑protection act have made the regulatory perimeter legible for both securities and non‑security tokens. In the Gulf, ADGM, DIFC/DFSA, and VARA all run full rulebooks with activity‑based licensing for custody, issuance, exchanges, and stablecoins. The common thread: every one of these jurisdictions is comfortable with tokenization when you behave like a supervised financial institution.

None of this is static, but it is stable enough to ship systems that obey the law by construction. The remainder of this chapter explains how we translate these regimes into executable code.

## Scope we support (today)

Our regulatory framework covers the jurisdictions where tokenization activity is most concentrated and where regulatory clarity enables compliant operations. Geographic coverage reflects both regulatory maturity and business opportunity, focusing on markets where legal frameworks provide clear guidance for tokenization activities.

In the European Union, we support the comprehensive regulatory framework that has emerged over the past decade. This includes MiFID II/MiFIR securities regulations that govern investment services and market operations, Prospectus Directive requirements that determine disclosure obligations for token offerings, and Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) that establishes infrastructure requirements for securities settlement. The DLT Pilot Regime for distributed ledger technology provides specific accommodations for blockchain-based market infrastructure, while the Electronic Money Directive (eWpG) covers tokenized payment solutions. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements are integrated throughout the platform, and Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) requirements provide the overarching framework for crypto-asset operations.

Gulf Cooperation Council coverage addresses the region's emergence as a major tokenization hub through comprehensive support for multiple regulatory frameworks. This includes Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) financial services regulations that provide clear legal pathways for digital asset operations, Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) frameworks that govern tokenized securities offerings, Saudi Capital Market Authority requirements for asset tokenization projects, and central bank directives across the region that establish operational standards for digital assets.

Singapore implementation reflects the jurisdiction's position as Asia's leading financial technology center. Coverage includes Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Payment Services Act provisions for payment token operations and Securities and Futures Act requirements for securities token offerings, along with comprehensive anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing guidelines that establish the compliance foundation for all digital asset activities.

The platform architecture is designed to be extensible to other regulatory regimes as tokenization frameworks mature globally. This includes preparation for Hong Kong's expanding digital asset regulations, various US state frameworks that are evolving rapidly, and emerging tokenization jurisdictions worldwide that are establishing legal clarity for blockchain-based financial operations.

## What the module does

Regulatory compliance traditionally relies on manual processes, periodic reviews, and post-hoc auditing that create gaps between actual operations and compliance obligations. Our regulatory compliance module transforms legal requirements into executable system logic that operates in real-time alongside business operations.

The jurisdictional rule library maintains versioned regulatory requirements including threshold amounts, eligibility criteria, reporting schedules, and marketing limitations as executable code rather than static documentation. These rules integrate directly with operational systems so compliance happens automatically rather than through separate manual processes that depend on human intervention and create opportunities for errors.

The jurisdiction setup wizard addresses one of the most common compliance failures in tokenization: selecting the wrong regulatory framework for a specific business model and investor base. The wizard guides organizations through framework selection by analyzing their business model and proposing appropriate regulatory paths such as EU private placement exemptions or MAS capital markets frameworks. The wizard collects necessary disclaimers and legal forms while preventing common misconfigurations that create compliance problems months or years later when regulatory reviews occur.

Automatic filing and electronic submission capabilities eliminate the manual data compilation and transcription processes that create compliance delays and errors. These capabilities connect to regulatory API endpoints where available, using data from custody, trading, and corporate action systems to generate required reports without manual data entry. Real-time regulatory alerts monitor all platform activity against legal thresholds, with the system automatically halting potentially non-compliant actions until regulatory obligations are satisfied. This prevents violations rather than detecting them after they occur.

Token classification guidance addresses the complex legal categorizations that determine regulatory treatment across different jurisdictions. Organizations must navigate between securities, electronic money, and payment tokens using jurisdiction-specific logic from MiCA and MAS frameworks, where small classification differences create vastly different compliance obligations. Digital identity integration supports DocuSign and Adobe e-signature solutions for routine business processes, with eIDAS advanced and qualified digital signatures for European regulatory filings that require higher authentication standards.

The regulatory audit dashboard provides read-only access for auditors and regulators, showing complete transaction histories and outstanding compliance tasks in formats that regulatory examiners expect to see. Multi-lingual legal interfaces, including Arabic support for GCC markets, prevent translation errors that can create regulatory problems when legal terms are misunderstood or incorrectly implemented.

Integration with the platform's compliance module ensures that legal definitions flow automatically into KYC and accreditation verification processes, eliminating inconsistencies between legal requirements and operational controls. This integration prevents the common problem where legal frameworks specify certain investor eligibility requirements while operational systems implement different verification criteria.

## Global baseline controls you can rely on

Rather than redrafting law per project, we maintain a baseline control set that satisfies the overlapping expectations of the regimes above. Eligibility and transfer rules live in token controllers, so illegal movements revert before state change. Identity and accreditation are verified through signed claims from trusted issuers and expressed as logical policies, so the same investor can qualify differently across products without re‑onboarding. A Travel‑Rule‑ready message generator accompanies off‑platform transfers between supervised entities. Custody segregation is expressed as a policy: omnibus is allowed only with look‑through attestations that keep the issuer’s cap table and eligibility truthful. Disclosures and marketing limits are templates with jurisdictional knobs; crossing a threshold raises a regulator‑grade alert and pauses the offending action until the appropriate filing or consent is on file. Settlement connects either to atomic DvP on chain or to bank rails with ISO 20022 receipts so there is always a legal record that ties token movement to fiat movement.

## KPIs that matter

Regulatory framework effectiveness must be measured through business outcomes that demonstrate real-world compliance capability rather than theoretical coverage. The success of our regulatory framework is measured through practical business outcomes that create competitive advantage for organizations using compliant tokenization infrastructure.

Time-to-market for new token offerings should be measured in weeks rather than months, demonstrating that regulatory compliance accelerates rather than hinders business development. This metric distinguishes between regulatory frameworks that enable business velocity and those that create bureaucratic delays. Cross-border coverage tracks the number of supported regions and measures the time required to add new jurisdictions, typically accomplished in days rather than quarters when regulatory frameworks are implemented as executable code rather than manual processes.

Alert efficacy approaches 100% by preventing regulatory violations before they occur rather than detecting them after the fact. This early approach eliminates the business disruption and regulatory sanctions that result from post‑hoc compliance detection. Legal cost reduction shows up in decreased outside counsel hours as routine compliance work becomes automated rather than requiring manual legal review for standard operations.

The ultimate measures are incident rates and audit efficiency metrics that demonstrate compliance effectiveness over time. We target zero major regulatory violations through early compliance controls that prevent issues rather than responding to violations after they occur. Audit preparation time should decrease significantly, typically by 30% or more, as complete audit trails and compliance documentation generate automatically from platform operations rather than requiring manual compilation and verification.

These metrics prove that comprehensive regulatory integration creates business value rather than operational overhead, enabling organizations to compete more effectively in regulated markets while maintaining full compliance with applicable legal frameworks.
